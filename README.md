We can use the cointegration indicator in combination with the other indicators to find equity index hedged pairs trades. Here we can see there is a z-score divergence of approximately 3 standard deviations between the S&P500 (red line) and Nasdaq (lime green line), which is confirmed with the cumulative delta MA indicator showing an opposite trend positioning. The price-action indication of long S&P500 can be used to time the entry to the trade, exiting on the convergence of the two instrument z-scores.
