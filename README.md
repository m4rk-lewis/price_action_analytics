- we can use the cointegration indicator in combination with the other indicators to find equity index hedged pairs trades. Here we can see there is a z-score divergence of aproximately 4 standard deviations between the S&P500 (red line) and EuroStoxx50 (white line), which is confirmed with the cumulative delta MA indicator showing an opposite trend positioning.
